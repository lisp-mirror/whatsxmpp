A WhatsApp Web transport for the [Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)](https://xmpp.org/), otherwise known as Jabber. (alpha!)

*This is the spiritual successor of [sms-irc](https://git.theta.eu.org/eta/sms-irc), a similar project that works with IRC instead of XMPP.*

## What is this?

This is a multi-user transport for WhatsApp, using the [whatscl](https://git.theta.eu.org/eta/whatscl)
library for Common Lisp. By scanning a QR code generated by the bridge with the WhatsApp
app on your phone, you can send and receive messages and media with your Jabber ID.

**Note:** You currently need an XMPP server of your own to try this. Setup instructions assume [prosody](https://prosody.im); the bridge
also works on [ejabberd](https://www.ejabberd.im/), but is not officially supported (though swing by the support MUC and we might
be able to provide some pointers, who knows).

## What works?

- Sending private messages/DMs both ways
- Support for MUCs
- Magically populating your roster using [XEP-0144: Roster Item Exchange](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0144.html)
- Downloading/decrypting media from WhatsApp and uploading it to your XEP-0363 server
- Avatars
- Read receipts
- Status text
- Typing notifications / chat state
- [XEP-0313: Message Archive Management](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html) in MUCs *only when enabled in configuration*
- Fetching your entire message history from WhatsApp and making it available via MAM *only when enabled in configuration*
- Users joining and leaving MUCs, and the topic changing (partial, requires XMPP-side rejoin)
- Uploading images to WhatsApp natively

## What doesn't yet?

- Uploading non-image media to WhatsApp (currently, it just comes through as a link)
- Probably other stuff

## What you'll need

- An XMPP server (we recommend [prosody](https://prosody.im/), but it might also work with ejabberd; let us know!)
  - You need to set up a new *external component* for the bridge ([see prosody doc](https://prosody.im/doc/components)).
  - In addition, you **must** configure an [XEP-0363 (HTTP File Upload)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html) component. ([see prosody doc](https://modules.prosody.im/mod_http_upload.html))
- An installation of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - You *can* try and run the bridge without Docker. However, we really don't recommend it, especially if you aren't familiar with Common Lisp.
  - Ask in the support MUC (link at the top of this file) if you want to do this.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) installed (specifically the `sqlite3` command**.

## Instructions

### Step 1: configure your XMPP server

Make sure you've followed the links above to set up XEP-0363 and an external component for the bridge. With prosody, your config might look something like:

**IMPORTANT**: The bridge MUST be allowed to upload things to the XEP-0363 server. For prosody's `mod_http_upload`, you should configure the
[`http_upload_access`](https://modules.prosody.im/mod_http_upload.html#access) option, as shown below. For ejabberd, you'll need to do something
with ACLs that I don't quite understand.

```
Component "upload.capulet.lit" "http_upload"
        http_upload_file_size_limit = 104857600
        http_upload_access = {"whatsapp.capulet.lit"}

Component "whatsapp.capulet.lit"
        component_secret = "juliet"
```

**WARNING**: Unless you want to run a public bridge (not recommended at this time), limit
access to the external component to only people on your server. (On prosody, add
`modules_disabled = { "s2s" }` to the component configuration.)

### Step 2: set up the database and storage for the bridge

I'm going to assume you want to store bridge data at the path `/wx`. Replace this path
with wherever you actually want to put the data in the commands below.

Set up the database schema:

```
$ sqlite3 /wx/data.sqlite3 < ./schema.sql
```

Then, configure the bridge -- replacing the values below with the actual values:

```
$ sqlite3 /wx/data.sqlite3
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> INSERT INTO configuration (rev, server, port, component_name, shared_secret, upload_component_name) VALUES (1, "capulet.lit", 5347, "whatsapp.capulet.lit", "juliet", "upload.capulet.lit");
sqlite> .quit
```

A few things to note here:

- The `port` is whatever port your XMPP server accepts incoming component connections on (*not* client-to-server or server-to-server connections!). For prosody, the default is 5347.
- The `component_name` is whatever you specified in the prosody config for this component.
- The `shared_secret` is the same as the `component_secret`.
- The `upload_component_name` is the name of the XEP-0363 HTTP Upload component.

#### Enabling archiving and full history fetches

If you want to be able to use the MAM and full history fetch features, you'll need to run some additional commands in the above `sqlite3` window.

To let users use MAM:

```
sqlite> UPDATE configuration SET allow_archiving = true;
```

To let users fetch their WhatsApp history:

```
sqlite> UPDATE configuration SET allow_history_fetches = true;
```

**WARNING:** These options are NOT recommended for people wishing to run a public instance of the bridge. (In fact, if you're doing that, come talk to us in the support MUC first, as there are various things you probably want to be made aware of.)

Note that users must still enable archiving manually via talking to the admin user and executing the `enable-archiving` command (and similarly for history fetches, which use the `full-history-fetch` command).


### Step 3: run the bridge

You can build the Docker image yourself from the `Dockerfile` in the repo, or you can just
use my hosted copy. (Don't download it a ton you guys, I pay for this stuff.)

You'll want to pass through the directory (`/wx`, or whatever it is) where you created
the database as a Docker volume, so the container can access it. Then, supply the path
to the database as the first argument to the container.

The hosted image is called `eu.gcr.io/etainfra/whatsxmpp`. Using the `docker` CLI,
you might run the bridge like so:

```
docker run \
    --name whatsxmpp \
    --restart always \
    -v /wx:/data \
    eu.gcr.io/etainfra/whatsxmpp \
    /data/data.sqlite3
```

Consult the [Docker reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) for more details
on this step, including how to run the image in the background and more!

If you see `Connection complete! \o/` in the logs, it's working!

### Step 4: set up the WhatsApp Web part

You'll interact with the bridge by talking to `admin@whatsapp.capulet.lit` (well,
the last part of that JID will be different depending on your setup). Send this user
`help` to check that the bridge is working (you should get some help text).

To set it up, have your phone at the ready to scan the QR code (Menu -> WhatsApp Web).
Then, send `register` to the admin user, and scan the QR code you're given.

(Did it break at this part and give you a nasty error? Check your XEP-0363 HTTP Upload
service is working correctly, and allows the bridge to use it as described above!)

You should then receive a crapton of presence subscription requests and MUC invites
for everyone you are remotely related to on WhatsApp, and for all the WhatsApp groups
you're in, and the bridge is done!

**Tip:** If your client supports [XEP-0144: Roster Item Exchange](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0144.html) (Gajim on desktop is good for this), send `getroster` to the admin user
to pop up a window where you can insert all your WhatsApp contacts in one go!
